# The Yellow Sign

###  About

**The Yellow Sign** is an experiment in how teams can work with their own knowledge more naturally.  
We’re building a **self-hosted knowledge base** - a tool that connects to your **GitLab** and automatically gathers  
Markdown documentation from all repositories into a single, searchable knowledge space.

It runs locally, inside your infrastructure, keeping everything private and under your control.  
The system helps you explore, link, and understand what’s already written -
showing original sources, references, and context behind every answer.

There’s also a simple role system for managing access and collaboration across teams.


### Get Involved
Curious minds, tinkerers, and knowledge cartographers are welcome.  
 *“Not everything that is written should be read.”*
